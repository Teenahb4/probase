    <h1 style="background-color:violet;">Impact Of SocialMedia On Euromaidan protest</h1>
    <h4>Exordium</h4>
    <p style="text-align: center;">As more than a billion people had done previously, on <ins>November 21, 2013</ins>
        <b>Ukrainian
            journalist</b> and activist <i>Mustafa Nayem</i> wrote a Facebook post; this post, however, would have a
        much larger impact
        on subsequent political developments than most that had preceded it. Frustrated with President Viktor
        Yanukovych's decision not to sign a long-promised association agreement with the European Union, Nayem asked
        others who shared his frustration to comment on his post. Even more importantly, Nayem wrote that if the post
        received at least 1000 comments from people willing to join him, they should all go to Independence Square to
        protest. And indeed they did: starting with just a few thousand people, the protests would swell to be the
        largest since Ukraine's independence, particularly after <strong>police used force against protesters</strong>
        at the end of
        November 2013. Eventually, these protests led to the resignation of the government, the exile of the former
        president, and indirectly to the secession of Crimea and the ongoing conflict in the eastern part of the
        country.

    <h4>Doctrine</h4>
    <p style="text-align: center;">While we are of course not claiming that <em>Nayem's original post was the sole cause
            of all that followed for
            Ukraine</em>, the EuroMaidan protests may be the first where we can point directly and unambiguously to
        social media
        as a <strong>pivotal moment of organization</strong>. <i>During the protests there was a large degree of
            speculation about the exact
            role of social media as they continued</i>. While a number of journalistic and blog accounts have described
        the uses
        of social media during the protests, scholarly research, on the other hand, is still emerging.</p>
    <h4>On The Whole</h4>
    <p style="text-align: center;">The essay proceeds as follows.<b> We turn first to the existing theoretical literature
        to identify potential mechanisms by which social media could impact both protest development at the macro-level
        and protest participation at the micro-level</b>. We then provide some background on the evolution of digital media
        in Ukraine from the Orange Revolution up to the EuroMaidan protests, as well as outline the way the EuroMaidan
        protests progressed. Against this background, we then explore the literature to date on the role of social media
        during the EuroMaidan protests. In the final part of the essay, <ins>we highlight a path forward for future research
        by outlining a number of important remaining questions</ins>.</p>
